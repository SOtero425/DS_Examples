Hypothesis: team metrics in the prior 10-15 games are stronger
  predictors of tournament success than season metrics.

Data: either get a web crawler or download a database with info,
  NCAA, NBA, whatever, and pull the data into the notebook.

Perform - and explain steps of - data cleaning, feature engineering
  (end of game score, score std, home vs away, opponent score vs. 
  opponent average, etc), correlation values, and generate some 
  visualizations to show my EDA approach.

In this specific case, build 2 models: 1 using whole season statistics,
  another using some number of prior games only. Split the data into
  train, validation, and test portions (I'm assuming it won't be sparse).
  Display confusion matrices along with model statistics (accuracy, 
  recall, etc.). Compare the results to see if there is an appreciable
  difference between results - bonus points for bringing in even more
  data to test the models on?

Next steps: include individual player statistics, injury flags, quarterly
  statistics, and more.

In order to meet their level of understanding, regular comments between
  each chunk - what's the purpose behind what I'm about to do - and
  discussion of the results afterwards.
